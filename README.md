# DATA-PIPELINE-DEVELOPMENT

This project implements a simple ETL pipeline using Python and scikit-learn.
It loads employee data from a CSV (or generates sample data if missing).
Negative salary values are removed to ensure clean input.
Numerical features are standardized, and categorical ones are one-hot encoded.
The transformed data is saved as transformed_data.csv for future analysis or modeling.
